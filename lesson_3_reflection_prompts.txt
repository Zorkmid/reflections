When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

1. When you don't have access to your main computer and need to update the repository
using a web interface.
2. When collaborating with another author making updates to a shared document or adding
files to a shared repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Gives the owner of the repository fine grained control over the contents.
